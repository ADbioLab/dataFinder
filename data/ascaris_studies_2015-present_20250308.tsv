SRP070744	PRJNA312925	2016-06-27 14:17:09	RNA was extracted from pooled samples of Anisaksi simplex (n= 134) using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen™, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), and DNase-treated using Turbo DNA-free™ (Ambion™, Austin, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amounts and integrity of total RNA were determined using a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). Polyadenylated (PolyA+) RNA was purified from 10 mg of total RNA from Anisakis simplex pool using Sera-Mag oligo(dT) beads, fragmented to a length of 100–500 nucleotides and reverse transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers. The size-fractionated cDNA was end-repaired and adaptor-ligated according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina). Ligated products of 200 bp were excised from agarose gels and PCR-amplified (15 cycles). Products were cleaned using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and paired-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

SRP140708	PRJNA450204	2018-04-19 00:07:58	For transcriptome sequencing on an Illumina platform a TruSeq RNA library generation was utilized. The library was generated by using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturers instructions. The library was quantified by using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). The library size was determined by using the High Sensitivity DNA Analysis Kit for the 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Libraries were adjusted to a concentration of 12 pM and sequenced on a HiSeq 1500 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in high-output mode. For cluster generation, the TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 was used. Cluster generation was performed on a cBot instrument. For sequencing the TruSeq SBS Kit v3 was used to sequence 100 + 100 bases.
